[in progress]

App for versioned modular writing, modeling stacks of index cards.  

When composing text on an "card", you can click a “keep version” button, and continue revising and adding to what you’ve written. All the versions you keep are stored in a “stack” of cards, with your last version on top. The texts from the top card of each stack are concatenated into a whole text document. 

You can compare the versions in each stack (in a view displaying word based diffs), and change your mind about which version to select as the top card. Supports some markdown.
