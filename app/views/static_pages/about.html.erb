    <h1>About Pale Fire</h1>

    <p>Pale Fire is a writing tool that lets you write, revise, and rearrange small pieces of text.</p>

    <p>It's inspired by the writer Vladimir Nabokov: he did his writing on index cards in pencil, continually changing, replacing and expanding what he'd written until it formed a novel.</p>

    <p>That is, he created a mobile and modular way of writing with version control.</p>

    <p>One of his novels, <em>Pale Fire</em>, features a character who himself uses this technique to write a strange long poem, also called 'Pale Fire.' The title is a reference to Shakepeare's lines about inspiration and creativity:
    </p>

    <p>
    <em>
      The moon's an arrant thief <br>
      And her pale fire she snatches from the sun.
    </em>
